</div>


<p class="cap">The following Observations are addressed
to the Public, with a view, on the one hand,
to do away certain erroneous prepositions
respecting the effects of Mercury, which
impede the necessary employment of it;
and on the other, to call its attention to the
impropriety of an indiscriminate use of this
medicine, by which much harm is often
done, and the medicine itself brought into
disrepute. The best way to effect these
purposes seems to be, to make the public
acquainted with what is really to be apprehended
from an improper use of mercury,
and the circumstances in which its bad
effects shew themselves; by which every
one may be enabled to distinguish these
effects from such as proceed from other
causes, as well as be warned against a use
of this medicine which has become too
prevalent.</p>

<p>Physicians will agree, that we do not
possess a more valuable medicine than mercury.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
Not to mention the diseases for the
cure of which it was first introduced,
which, without its aid, almost uniformly
prove fatal, and in which it is almost uniformly
successful, we may appeal for the
truth of this observation to its effects in
some of the most dangerous forms of scrophula,
in dropsies of different kinds, in
inflammations, particularly chronic inflammations,
and induration and enlargement of
the different viscera.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> If we except worm cases, in which mercury probably
acts on the worms themselves, the various diseases
in which mercury is useful, may perhaps be
reduced to the two heads of inflammation and glandular
obstruction. I believe there is nothing more
erroneous than the opinion, that mercury will occasionally
succeed in almost all diseases. This opinion
has led to its employment in improper cases, and tended
consequently to bring it into discredit. I have never
found it successful except in the diseases here alluded to.</p>

</div>

<p>For many years after its introduction into
practice, it was confined to a few diseases.
At length it occurred to physicians, that a
remedy, which in these proved so efficacious,
might produce similar effects in other
cases; and such has been the success of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
trial, that during the last twenty years
mercury has been coming into general use,
with a rapidity unequalled in the history of
any other medicine. But the more we are
assured of its value, the more cautious we
ought to be in its employment; both because
it is of the greater consequence to
prevent any prepossession against it, and because
we know that there is no active medicine
which can safely be trifled with.</p>

<p>The prejudices which prevail against the
use of mercury seem to arise from three
sources; the nature of the complaints in
which it was first employed; the uneasiness
which even its salutary operation, when
carried to a certain extent, necessarily occasions;
and the bad consequences which
sometimes attend an improper use of it. It
is surprising, that the first of these causes
should operate against its use; yet such is
the confusion which naturally creeps into
our ideas on subjects in which we are not
habitually interested, that the prejudices of
not a few originate from this cause. Of
such a prejudice it is surely unnecessary to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
say any thing. The other objections to the
use of mercury are of more weight.</p>

<p>Like all other medicines which increase
the secretion by the skin, the use of mercury
tends to debilitate, and render the body
more susceptible of cold. When mercury
does not encrease any other excretion, the
debility it occasions seems to be proportioned
to the degree in which it promotes
perspiration; and medicines which promote
perspiration in a greater degree produce
more sudden debility. We see a degree
of weakness produced by the operation of
James’s powders, or of Dover’s powders,
(opium and ipecacuanha), in a few days
which a moderate course of mercury would
not occasion in many weeks.</p>

<p>Such is the tendency of mercury to promote
the secretion by the skin, that it often
runs off in this way almost as fast as it is
received into the system, particularly on its
first being used; so that it is sometimes
difficult to make a sufficient quantity be retained
to produce its desired effect. Some
of the good effects of mercury seem, in a
great measure, to arise from this action of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
it, particularly its tendency to counteract
the inflammatory disposition and to relieve
actual inflammation.</p>

<p>This tendency of mercury readily accounts
for the bad effects of taking cold
under its influence. It is easy to conceive
that the bad effects of checking perspiration
will be most felt when, to use a common
expression, the pores are most open, that is,
when the secretion by the skin is most copious;
for the greater the quantity of fluid
thus discharged, the greater inconvenience
is to be expected from suddenly checking
its secretion. Hence also the danger of
suddenly checking perspiration, when, by
exercise or external warmth, it is rendered
more copious than usual.</p>

<p>Such is the admirable constitution of our
bodies, that means are provided for more or
less successfully counteracting the operation
of every thing which tends to injure them.
If a thorn or any other extraneous body is
introduced under the skin, inflammation
and suppuration spontaneously arise, by
which the offending cause is expelled. If a
poisonous substance is received into the stomach,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
the action of vomiting is frequently
excited, or if it passes into the bowels, nature
still endeavours to carry it off by an
increase of the peculiar motion of the intestines,
and of the secretion from their surface;
so in the case before us, the morbid
fullness which would in every instance arise,
when perspiration suffers a check, is generally
prevented by the sympathy which
subsists between the skin and several other
secreting organs, in consequence of which,
as soon as a check is given to the action of
the former, some one of the latter, which
secrete a similar fluid from the blood, is
called into more vigorous action, and what
should have passed by the skin is thrown off
by the kidneys or bowels, sometimes by the
glands of the nose, throat, and lungs, occasioning
what we call a <em>cold</em>.</p>

<p>This substitution of one excretion for
another, if I may use the expression, is
particularly apt to occur under the use of
mercury, and seems to arise from the nature
of this medicine being so stimulating
that we cannot retain it in the system: if
one vent is denied it, it quickly finds another.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Hence it is that people under the effects of
mercury are so subject to an increased secretion
from the kidneys and intestines, and
from the glands of the mouth and throat.</p>

<p>It is of great consequence in most cases,
in conducting a course of mercury, as much
as possible to prevent its running off, and as
we cannot wholly confine it, our plan is to
direct it to that channel thro’ which it
passes off most slowly; for it is well known
that this and some other medicines, while
they particularly excite any one excreting
organ, are not apt to pass off at the same
time in considerable quantity by any other.
Now the channel by which mercury passes
off most slowly is the glands of the mouth,
and fauces. Our view, therefore, is generally
to direct it to this channel, and the
degree in which it increases the secretion
from these glands is a sufficiently accurate
measure of the quantity of mercury in the
body, as we generally find that the effects
of mercury in removing disease are proportioned
to the degree in which it affects the
mouth. Besides the discharge, and consequently
the debility, occasioned by the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
quantity of mercury, is less when it excites
these glands, than when it acts on the skin
and bowels.</p>

<p>While it increases the secretion from the
glands of the mouth and fauces, it irritates
and inflames them, and the inflammation it
excites when the quantity which passes in
this way is great, often becoming considerable
and spreading to neighbouring parts,
much uneasiness is sometimes occasioned.</p>

<p>The symptoms of salivation form the
chief of the bad effects, which are peculiar
to this medicine. They are indeed unpleasant,
but they are unattended with
danger. It is rarely proper to induce
them. A physician may practice for several
years without meeting with one instance
in which salivation is necessary; and the
extent to which the older practitioners
were accustomed on every occasion to carry
the use of mercury, may be regarded as one
of the greatest abuses which have opposed
the beneficial employment of this medicine.
It has certainly more than any other tended
to confirm the prejudices against it. All its
good effects can in most cases be obtained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
by slightly affecting the mouth, and keeping
up this affection for a longer or shorter
time, according as the complaint proves
more or less obstinate.</p>

<p>In certain formidable cases which, we
have reason to believe, if left to themselves
would prove fatal, and in which more gentle
means have failed, it is proper to induce
salivation. But may not a similar objection
be brought against the use of most other
medicines? There are few whose operation,
is not attended with some inconvenience.
How alarming would be the operation of an
emetic were we not accustomed to see it!
Violent vomiting is a symptom occasioned by
some of the most fatal poisons, yet we are
easily reconciled to it when assured of its
beneficial tendency.</p>

<p>From what has been said, the reader will
readily perceive, why a sudden salivation is
often the effect of taking cold under the
operation of mercury. We have no means
of immediately checking a salivation. Discontinuing
the use of the mercury, employing
gentle laxatives, and avoiding every
thing which tends to irritate the inflamed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
surface of the mouth and fauces will lessen
the inflammation and discharge, and by
degrees remove them.</p>

<p>When the mercury instead of falling on
the glands of the mouth and fauces, is thrown
on the bowels in consequence of taking cold,
it is more in our power to regulate and restrain
the discharge. For the most part this
affection of the bowels is a mere diarrhœa.
The griping pains which sometimes attend it
seem to arise from the copious secretion
from the intestines washing off the mucus
which is the natural defence against the
irritation of their contents. When this affection
is allowed to continue, and no care is
taken to defend the bowels, dysenteric
symptoms sometimes shew themselves;
these are most frequently the consequence
of mercury taken internally, as I shall presently
have occasion more particularly to
observe.</p>

<p>This affection of the bowels may be induced
in another way. It will have nearly
the same effect, whether the fluid, which
should pass by the skin is thrown on the
bowels in consequence of the action of the
skin being checked by taking cold, or in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
consequence of this fluid being directed to
the bowels by any cause of irritation applied
to their surface. Hence it is, that indigestible
and irritating food will often produce
such a change in the distribution of the
fluids, that the increased secretion by the skin
or salivary glands, occasioned by the mercury,
shall be exchanged for that by the bowels.</p>

<p>When the mercury is thrown on the kidneys
it passes off, as by the skin, without
uneasiness of any kind; and as in this case
also, the only bad consequences are, that
the mercury, instead of acting on the system
for the cure of the disease for which it is
given, is drained from the body, and the
patient is sometimes weakened by the increased
discharge. Mercury may, to a certain
degree, be diverted from the kidneys by the
use of certain astringent medicines. Those
which direct it to the skin, by increasing
the action of this organ, will divert it from
the kidneys; but by this we should lose, not
gain, as it is thrown off by the former more
rapidly than by the latter.</p>

<p>In many cases the action of mercury on
the kidneys is salutary, and our aim is as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
much as possible, by the use of diuretic medicines,
to direct it to this channel; for it
happens with respect to the kidneys, as
with respect to the bowels, that whatever
tends to irritate and increase the discharge
from them, solicits the mercury to them.
It is partly in this way that it often proves a
cure in various species of dropsy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As far as we have considered the effects of
mercury, its debilitating tendency seems to
arise from the evacuation it occasions. But
it debilitates in another way, which has not
been sufficiently attended to. Whatever
weakens the stomach and bowels is soon
felt in every part of the system, and even
medical men, as far as I can judge, are not
in general sufficiently aware of the bad
effects which often arise from the internal
use of mercury. To prescribe calomel, one
of the most active preparations of this medicine,
with the same freedom, and for the
same purposes, as rhubarb or senna, is in my
opinion altogether a misapplication of it.</p>

<p>Few things apply to the stomach and intestines
a more hurtful irritation. I have
often seen temporary dysentery induced by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
few doses of calomel, and I am convinced
from many cases that its habitual or even
occasional use as an aperient, however innocent
it may seem at the time, seldom fails at
length to debilitate the powers of digestion,
and is often productive of still worse consequences.
Calomel is frequently given to
children because it has little taste, and may
be given in small compass. But it is better
to give a milder medicine, tho’ a larger
quantity may be required. Perhaps the
smallness of the quantity in which it operates
is of itself a sufficient objection, for
there is no aperient which operates in very
small quantity that operates mildly, as we
might have foreseen, although the trial had
not been made. For my own part, I know
of few instances in which the internal use of
mercury seems proper. There are some
cases where powerful means are required to
rouse the bowels to action, or a strong stimulus
applied to their exhaling vessels is
beneficial; and mercury is sometimes successfully
employed internally for the removal
of worms, but in ordinary cases
we can surely with equal advantage use a
less irritating medicine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>When mercury is not employed as an
aperient, but for the purpose of impregnating
the system, what advantage is there
in giving it by the mouth. It seldom happens
that we cannot give as much as we
wish by the skin. I have known many who
were less debilitated by an ounce of mercury
taken by the skin, than by half a dram
received even in the smallest doses into the
stomach.</p>

<p>In short, the objections to the use of mercury
by the skin, seem all to resolve themselves
into the two above treated of, the
debility occasioned by an increase of some
of the excretions, and a greater susceptibility
to the effects of cold.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> While there
are the same objections to the internal use
of mercury, there are far more weighty ones,
which are not the less so, because we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
with the same precision define them. All
that we know of them is, that they chiefly
consist in a debility of the stomach and intestines,
which gives rise to the various dyspeptic
complaints, flatulence, acidity, diarrhœa,
and dysentery, effects which I have
so often witnessed from the internal use of
mercury, that I have for some years
almost wholly abandoned it, except in the
cases above alluded to.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[B]</a> It is unnecessary to notice a variety of groundless
opinions, respecting the effects of mercury, which
prevail among the vulgar, that it remains for ever in
the system, causes a rottenness of the bones, &amp;c.
These are similar to the prejudices which prevailed respecting
the bark for a long time after its introduction
into practice, that it was formed into masses in the
stomach and bowels, from which it could never be expelled;
that nobody survived the use of it more than
seven years, &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>The precautions suggested by what has
been said will, I believe, in every instance,
prevent the bad effects of mercury, with the
exception of the symptoms of salivation,
which it is now and then necessary to induce.
It will be proper to take a cursory
view of these precautions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As by promoting the excretions, mercury
tends to debilitate, it must be used with
caution in weak habits, and its debilitating
effects should be counteracted by the use of
such strengthening medicines as are adapted
to the case in which we employ it. The
debilitating effects of mercury, however,
are not such as many suppose. In a habit
of ordinary strength, a moderate course<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
of mercury, properly conducted, produces
little debility, and I have seen many under
such a course recover both their strength
and flesh. The mercury gives vigour, by
removing the cause which impairs it. With
caution there is no danger in making a trial
of mercury in the most debilitated habit. In
such the quantity first employed should be
too small to produce any effect whatever.
Let it be gradually increased; if, as often
happens, the strength improves, let it be
continued; if the strength be much impaired
by it, it should be laid aside.</p>

<p>Nothing tends more to debilitate under
the use of mercury, than the unfortunate
idea, that the patient should be denied the
advantage of free air and exercise. Under
certain circumstances, confinement to the
house is proper. When it is necessary to
induce salivation, the patient should remain
at home. The inconvenience, indeed,
of going out is sufficient to prevent
it. Under even the gentlest course of mercury,
he should remain at home in damp
cold weather, and after sun-set. With
these exceptions, he should be as much in
the open air as his strength will permit. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
is not exposure to a cool, or even a cold air,
that checks perspiration. In a dry cold air,
with a due degree of exercise, the insensible
perspiration is perhaps freer than under any
other circumstances. All that is necessary
with respect to temperature is, that it shall
not be so low that the quantity of exercise,
which the patient can take without inconvenience,
shall not be sufficient to keep up a
proper degree of heat.</p>

<p>All sudden changes of temperature, particularly
that from warm to cold, (which,
notwithstanding the refinements of some
modern philosophers, may easily, I believe,
be proved to be the most pernicious) are to be
guarded against. The same may be said of
partial exposure to cold. In short, it is not
exposure to cold, but exposure to the causes
of what we call taking cold, that is injurious
to those under the use of mercury.</p>

<p>Strong exercises, I mean such as induce
any degree of sensible perspiration, and all
kinds of fatigue, are hurtful.</p>

<p>All indigestible and irritating articles of
food should be avoided by those under the
influence of mercury, both because it is
proper, under the use of all medicines<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
which promote the excretions, to avoid
whatever debilitates, and because every
thing that irritates the bowels tends to solicit
a more copious secretion from them, and
thus to divert the mercury from the channel,
to which it is our aim to direct it.
On this account much wine, strong and
high seasoned food, and whatever tends
to produce flatulence and acidity, are
injurious.</p>

<p>The diet, however, should not be low,
as was once recommended under the use of
mercury, which, combined with the confinement,
tended to produce the greater part
of the debility attributed to the effects of
the medicine. It should be nourishing,
mild, and in some degree mucilaginous.
Wine should be drank in preference to every
other kind of fermented liquor. The
stronger wines should be diluted. The
quantity should be moderate, but proportioned
to the patient’s habits.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
